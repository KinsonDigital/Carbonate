<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">New Features ‚ú®</h2>

1. [#43](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Carbonate/issues/43) - Added an exception to the `Reactable` class when invoking the methods below after disposal.
   >üí°This gives the benefit of letting the user know what is expected after using the object after invoking `Reactable.Dispose()`. 
   - `Reactable.Subscribe()`
   - `Reactable.Push()`
   - `Reactable.PushData()`
   - `Reactable.PushMessage()`
   - `Reactable.Unsubscribe()`
   - `Reactable.UnsubscribeAll()`
2. [#39](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Carbonate/issues/39) - Added a new property named `Name` to the `IReactable` interface and `Reactable` class.
   >üí°This is used to help with debugging and personal identification.  

   >‚ö†Ô∏èThis is not used in anyway to identify unique `Reactors` subscribed to the `Reactable`.  That is the purpose of the `EventId` property.
3. [#39](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/Carbonate/issues/39) - Added a default implementation of the `Reactor.ToString()` method that shows the name of the `Reactor` combined with the `EventId`
   >üí°If a name is used, the format will be _**'\<name\> - \<event-id\>'**_ and _**'\<event-id\>'**_ if no name is used.
